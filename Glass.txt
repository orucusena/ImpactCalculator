Producing glass from virgin materials requires 30 percent more energy than producing it from crushed, used glass.

The energy saved from recycling one glass bottle will operate a 100-watt light bulb for four hours.

It takes approximately 1 million years for a glass bottle to break down at the landfill.

Glass is very easy to recycle; waste bottles and jars can be melted down and used again and again. You simply toss old glass into the furnace with the ingredients you're using to make brand-new glass. Bottle banks (large containers where waste glass is collected) were the original examples of community recycling in many countries.
